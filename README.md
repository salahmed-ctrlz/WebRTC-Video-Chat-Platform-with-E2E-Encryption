Features
Secure video calls using WebRTC.
Support for one-to-one and room-based private calls.
Secure signaling with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
End-to-end encryption using ECDH key exchange.
Lightweight UI with intuitive controls.
Installation
Since this repository contains only the main files, you need to install some additional dependencies (JavaScript libraries, Node.js modules, etc.) to run the project.

Prerequisites
Node.js: Install from nodejs.org
npm (usually comes with Node.js)
A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
Steps
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/webrtc-video-chat.git
cd webrtc-video-chat
Install Dependencies

This project uses Node.js on the server-side and may rely on front-end libraries. To install the required modules, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
This command reads the package.json file and installs all the necessary dependencies (such as Express for the server, socket.io for signaling, and any other libraries you might be using).

Additional JavaScript Libraries

If your project requires additional client-side JavaScript libraries (for example, for WebRTC support or UI enhancements), ensure they are included in your HTML files via CDN links or place them in the appropriate directory.

Running the Application
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application by running the server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
This will start your Node.js server (for example, on port 3000 by default). You should see output similar to:

arduino
Copy
Edit
Server running on port 3000...
Using Ngrok
Ngrok is a tool that creates a secure tunnel to your local server, allowing you to test your application over the internet without deploying to a cloud server.

Steps to Use Ngrok
Download and Install Ngrok

Visit ngrok.com and download the version for your operating system.
Unzip the downloaded file and move the ngrok executable to a directory in your PATH.
Start Ngrok

With your local server running on port 3000 (or the port specified in your configuration), open a new terminal window and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
ngrok http 3000
Access the Public URL

Ngrok will display a forwarding URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io). You can share this URL with testers or access it from any device to use your WebRTC Video Chat Platform over the internet.

Usage
Creating or Joining a Room:
Open the application in your browser.
Choose whether to create a new room or join an existing one by entering a room ID.
The signaling server will handle room management and peer connection setup.
Video Chat Controls:
Use the on-screen buttons to toggle your camera and microphone.
To end the call, simply click the 'End Call' button.
