## Features

- **Secure Video Calls:** Utilizes WebRTC for real-time communication.
- **Private Rooms:** Supports creating and joining private rooms for group calls.
- **End-to-End Encryption:** Implements secure signaling with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and ECDH key exchange.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive controls for toggling video/audio and managing calls.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Easily extendable to support more advanced features.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** (v12 or later)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

---

## Installation

This repository includes the core files of the application. To install the required dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/webrtc-video-chat.git
   cd webrtc-video-chat
   ```

2. **Install Server-Side Dependencies**

   Install the necessary Node.js modules (e.g., Express, Socket.io):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Additional Client-Side Libraries**

   If your project requires extra JavaScript libraries (for WebRTC support or UI enhancements), include them either via CDN in your HTML files or place them in the `public` directory.

---

## Running the Application

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start the application using:

```bash
npm start
```

By default, the server will run on port `3000`. You should see a message in the console:

```
Server running on port 3000...
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the app.

---

## Using Ngrok

Ngrok allows you to expose your local server to the internet, making it easy to test your application from remote devices or share it with others.

1. **Download and Install Ngrok**

   - Go to [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/), sign up (if necessary), and download the appropriate version for your OS.
   - Unzip the package and move the executable to a directory included in your system’s PATH.

2. **Start Ngrok**

   With your application running locally on port 3000, open a new terminal window and execute:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

3. **Access the Public URL**

   Ngrok will display a forwarding URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`). Share this URL or use it on your mobile device to access your WebRTC Video Chat Platform over the internet.

## Usage

### Creating or Joining a Room

1. **Open the Application:**
   - Navigate to the local URL or Ngrok URL in your browser.

2. **Create/Join a Room:**
   - To **create** a room, click the "Create Room" button; a unique room ID will be generated.
   - To **join** a room, enter the room ID provided by another user and click "Join Room".

3. **Start Video Chat:**
   - Use the on-screen controls to toggle your camera/microphone and manage your call.
   - The application will handle peer connections and secure signaling automatically.
